\label{Appendix/System-Manual}

\section{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item JDK 1.6
\item Maven3
\item Git
\end{itemize}

\section{Build}
To compile and run all the tests, in the project root directory run: 
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\$ mvn clean install}
\end{quote}

\section{Run}

The experiments are located in the \texttt{experiment/} module: \texttt{vwap-error} and \texttt{vwap-no-error}.

\begin{quote}
\texttt{\$ mvn pax:run}
\end{quote}

\section{Distribution}
In order to run a \texttt{*.zip} file with a standalone experiment that can be run without \texttt{Maven3}, execute:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\$ mvn clean install assembly:single}
\end{quote}
This will create a \texttt{*.zip} file in the \texttt{target/} subdirectory, which can be distributed. In order to run the experiment, unpack the \texttt{*.zip} file and use the bash script located in the \texttt{bin/} directory:
\begin{quote}
\texttt{\$ sh start.sh}
\end{quote}
