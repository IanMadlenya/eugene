\section{Requirements Analysis}
\label{Chapters/Analysis-and-Design/Requirements-Analysis}

Having analysed available literature on the design of asynchronous, limit order book markets in \Cref{Chapters/Background/Market-Microstructure}, as well as existing Agent-Based ASMs in \Cref{Chapters/Background/Agent-Based-Modelling}, we will now list the requirements that the trading simulator needs to satisfy. Requirements are prioritised according to the MoSCoW approach (M - Must, S - Should, C - Could and W - Would).

\multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Market Agent}}   	         \\
F01  & The Execution Engine shall match orders in the Order Book & M \\ 
F02  & The Market Agent shall accept limit/market orders and order cancellations. & M \\
F03  & The Market Agent shall provide \textit{level 2} market data access with anonymous OrderIDs to Trader Agents. & M \\
F04  & The Market Agent shall report order executions and status changes back to the original Trader Agent. & M \\ 
F05  & The Market Agent shall log all market events to a file.        & M \\
F06  & The Market Agent shall publish performance statistics at runtime. & C \\

\multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Simulation Agent}}   \\
F07  & The Simulation Agent shall start  the Market Agent and Trader Agents.  & M \\
F08  & The Simulation Agent shall synchronise the start of a simulation. & M \\
F09  & The Simulation Agent shall stop a simulation after a specified amount of time. & M \\
F10  & The Simulation Agent shall send initial orders before starting the simulation. & M \\ 

\multicolumn{3}{c}{\textbf{Client API}}   \\
F11  & The Client API shall handle the low-level interaction with the Market Agent and Simulation Agent and provide callback methods for receiving messages. & M \\
