\section{Use Case Analysis}
The use cases are listed in~\Cref{Appendix/Use-Cases}. Their application to Integration testing is explained in~\Cref{Chapters/Implementation/Integration-Testing}. For details of interaction between the \texttt{Market Agent} and \texttt{Execution Engine} (especially how the \texttt{Execution Engine} communicates with the \texttt{Trader Agents}), see~\Cref{Chapters/Implementation/Market-Agent}, as the description in the use cases is simplified.
