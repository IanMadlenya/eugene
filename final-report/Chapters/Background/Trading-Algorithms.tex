\section{Trading Algorithms}
\label{Chapters/Background/Trading-Algorithms}
Trading Algorithms are sophisticated real-time systems that enter trading orders and decide on aspects of the order like timing, price and quantity, without human intervention. The basic classification can be made between \textit{benchmark} and \textit{profit} algorithms. Benchmark algorithms are designed to be used by human traders in order to implement trading strategies in a cost-effective manner, whereas profit algorithms proactively search for profit-opportunities and enter the market without human intervention. For an overview of Trading Algorithms, see~\cite{MacKenzie2011}.
