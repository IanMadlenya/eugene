\section{Noise Trader Agent (agent/noise/)}
\label{Chapters/Implementation/Noise-Agent}

The \texttt{Noise Trader Agent} implements the \textit{zero-intelligence model of price formation} (see~\Cref{Chapters/Background/Zero-Intelligence-Model}), with the following simplifications:
\begin{itemize}
\item The \texttt{Noise Trader Agent} does not track neither its cash nor inventory position. This decision was made in order to simplify the implementation.
\item The sleeping times come from a uniform distribution $[1,s_{max}]$, as the library code used for generating numbers from required distributions did not have the functionality to generate numbers from a mixture of two exponential distributions, and no suitable replacement library was found. Moreover, preliminary results showed that the \texttt{Noise Trader Agent} activity was irregular enough for the experiments.
\end{itemize}

The remaining parameters and distributions come from the original paper by~\citet{Gilles2006} and are summarised in~\Cref{Table/Zero-Intelligence}. The \texttt{Noise Trader Agent} uses \texttt{commons-math} library~\cite{commons-math} to generate random numbers from required distributions. Also, the \texttt{Noise Trader Agent} uses the \texttt{Client API} (see~\Cref{Chapters/Implementation/Client-API}) to rebuild the \texttt{Order Book} in order to track current prices, through the \texttt{TopOfBookApplication} (see~\Cref{Chapters/Implementation/Order-Book}) .
