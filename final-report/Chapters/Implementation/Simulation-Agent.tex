\section{Simulation Agent (simulation/agent/)}
\label{Chapters/Implementation/Simulation-Agent}
The \texttt{Simulation Agent} implements use cases \textit{UC1} and \textit{UC9}. It starts the \texttt{Market Agent}, awaits for messages that synchronise the start of \texttt{Trader Agents}, sends the initial orders and starts and stops the simulation. 

When starting the \texttt{Trader Agents}, \texttt{Simulation Agent} passes an implementation of \texttt{eugene.simulation.agent.Simulation} that defines methods for obtaining the address of the \texttt{Market Agent}, the \texttt{Simulation Agent} and the instrument definition (name, tick size and default price).
