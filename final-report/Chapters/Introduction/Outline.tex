\section{Outline of the Report \label{Chapters/Introduction/Outline}}

In \Cref{Chapters/Background/Market-Microstructure} we describe the model of the market mechanism we will use in the simulator. We describe the market architectures employed in the stock exchanges during continuous trading sessions, namely the model of a limit order book, and how it enables market participants to interact asynchronously.

In \Cref{Chapters/Background/Agent-Based-Modelling} we summarise several artificial stock markets from the available literature. We provide a model of zero-intelligence agents that will be implemented by the Noise Traders, that is based on the work by~\citet[chap.~4]{Gilles2006}. Moreover, in order to provide a background for implementing a VWAP Trading Algorithm for the experiments, we survey available sources, most prominently the work in~\citet{Coggins2006, Kakade2004}.

\Cref{Chapters/Analysis-and-Design} provides an analysis of the design of the system, by presenting the main elements of a Trading System and \textit{Eugene}'s place in the architecture. We introduce the overall design and relations between the main modules and provide a summary of requirements and use cases that the modules set out to implement.

In \Cref{Chapters/Implementation} we highlight the main principles that guided the implementation of the simulator and provide the implementation details of all modules. Lastly, the unit and integration testing strategies are presented. 

\Cref{Chapters/Experiments-and-Results} summarises the steps taken in order to evaluate the efficacy of the system according to the null-hypotheses presented in~\Cref{Chapters/Introduction/Research-Objective-and-Null-Hypotheses}.

Finally, in \Cref{Chapters/Conclusions-and-Further-Work} we summarise the key points of this work and its applicability to testing Trading Algorithms. We then review the contributions and achievements introduce the possible extensions to this project.
